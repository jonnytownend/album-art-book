# Album Art Book
A React web app that generates a printable PDF of album covers based on a user's Spotify and iTunes listening history. The aim of this project is catalogue a user's music collection in a non-digital, physical format.

> _This project is inspired by my fear of loosing my digital music collection in the distant future, and the fact that I own very little physical music anymore. My hope is that such a book will be found - dusty and discoloured - in a loft somewhere in 30 years time, and I'll be able to look back over my music library long after my hard drives and streaming service login details have been lost / damaged / burnt / destroyed in a nuclear apocolypse._

Note: This repository supercedes an older Python implementation - see the original repo [here](https://github.com/jonnytownend/itunes-booklet).
